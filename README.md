# Why I created this 

While watching online web development tutorials, I felt inspired to create a music project. However, I realized that relying solely on the local storage of my computer is not a good practice. This led me to explore cloud storage and accessing it via a content delivery network (CDN). Someone suggested that to make this type of project easier, I should learn a server-side language. Upon further research, I discovered that using a server-side language would streamline my HTML coding by handling file and database management. Unfortunately, my research was interrupted, and now that my exams are over, I plan to delve deeper into learning a server-side language and database management.

I already have some familiarity with MySQL commands, which you can find in my school projects folder. I intend to utilize this knowledge to enhance my web development skills and create a robust and efficient music project that can access cloud storage. Ultimately, I hope to showcase this project in my portfolio.

# How to use this

To use this music webpage on your localhost, please follow these steps:

1. Download the folder containing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
2. Unzip the folder to extract its contents.
3. Once unzipped, locate the file named "index.html" and double-click on it.
4. This will open the webpage in your default web browser.

On the webpage, you'll find the following features:

- Play Songs: You can play the available songs on the music site. When you click on a song, it will start playing, and the progress bar will update according to the duration of the song.
- Change Songs: You can change the current song by using the time bar. Drag the time bar to the desired position, and the corresponding song will start playing from that point.
- Pause Song: To pause the currently playing song, click on the pause button located on the left side of the progress bar.
- Song History: The songs you listen to will be displayed in the history section on the right side of the screen. Note that currently, repeated songs may appear in the history, but this will be addressed later.
- Song Information: When you play a song, you will see an alert box displaying the index and name of the song. This will be removed in a future update to enhance the user experience.
- Responsive Design: Please note that the webpage is currently not optimized for mobile phones, and it may not display properly on smaller screens.

Known Issues and Future Improvements:

1. Removing Alert Box: The alert box displaying song information will be removed in a future update to avoid interrupting the user experience.
2. History: In a future update, the repeated songs will be prevented from appearing in the song history section.
3. Lag when Changing Song Duration: There might be occasional lag when changing the duration of a song. This issue will be addressed to improve performance.
4. Backward and Forward Buttons: The backward and forward buttons are currently not functioning. This functionality will be added in a future update to allow users to navigate between songs more easily.
5. SVG Usage: The webpage will be updated to use SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) instead of image files for better scalability and performance.
6. Mobile Responsiveness: The webpage will be optimized for mobile phones to ensure proper display and functionality on smaller screens.

Please note that these improvements and bug fixes are planned for future updates to enhance the functionality and user experience of the music webpage.
